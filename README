This is an implementation of the 2048 game in which the player aims to combine blocks
until getting a 2048 block or higher ones!

All the source code is contained in "main.py"

For setting up the game, you must install the libraries listed at "requirements.txt": pygame at the moment
Next you must unzip "Anton.zip" to get "Anton-Regular.ttf" which the game uses to render text.

That's all. Run "python main.py" and get the highest score! ;)

You can also run "python main.py h w gn" where "h" will be the board's height, "w" the board's width
and "gn" the number of blocks generated per movement.
